/// Contains implementation of the inversion of control container, which creates objects
/// and controls their lifecycle(*) using various configurations.
///
/// Using generic containers, we can create more specialized containers â€“ one of which is the process
/// container. It represents a system process, receives its configuration file via the command line,
/// and creates a container, starts it, reads its configuration, recreates objects, runs them, and then,
/// after pressing ctrl-c, turns off and destroys the objects.
///
/// Another example of containers are lambda functions, service fabric containers, and so on.
///
/// ### (*) Component lifecycle: ###
///
/// External configurations (stored as YAML or JSON) are passed to the container
/// and define the structure of objects that need to be recreated in the container.
/// Objects can be defined in two ways:
/// - using descriptors (using which registered factories can recreate the object)
/// - using hard-coded types (objects are recreated directly, based on their type, bypassing
/// factories).
///
/// In addition, various configurations are stored for each object. The container recreates the
/// objects and, if they implement the IConfigurable interface, passes them their configurations.
///
/// Once the objects of a container are configured, if they implement the [IReferenceable interface](https://pub.dev/documentation/pip_services3_commons/latest/pip_services3_commons/IReferenceable-class.html),
/// they are passed a set of references for recreating links between objects in the container. If
/// objects implement the [IOpenable interface](https://pub.dev/documentation/pip_services3_commons/latest/pip_services3_commons/IOpenable-class.html),
/// the [open()] method is called and they
/// start to work. Connections to various services are made, after which the objects start, the
/// container starts running, and the objects carry out their tasks. When the container
/// starts to close, the objects that implement the [IClosable interface](https://pub.dev/documentation/pip_services3_commons/latest/pip_services3_commons/IClosable-class.html)
/// are closed via their
/// [close()] method (which should make them stop working and disconnect from other services),
/// after which objects that implement the [IUnreferenceable interface](https://pub.dev/documentation/pip_services3_commons/latest/pip_services3_commons/IUnreferenceable-class.html) delete various links between
/// objects, and, finally, the contains destroys all objects and turns off.
