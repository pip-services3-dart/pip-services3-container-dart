/// Container configuration serves as a recipe for instantiating and
/// configuring components inside the container.
///
/// External configurations (stored as YAML or JSON) are passed to the container
/// and define the structure of objects that need to be recreated in the container.
/// Objects can be defined in two ways:
/// - using descriptors (using which registered factories can recreate the object)
/// - using hard-coded types (objects are recreated directly, based on their type, bypassing
/// factories).
///
/// In addition, various configurations are stored for each object. The container recreates the
/// objects and, if they implement the IConfigurable interface, passes them their configurations.
